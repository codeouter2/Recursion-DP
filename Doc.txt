Recursion : function calls itself it is called as recursion.

How to implement : 
1. Need base condition and always return it.- where to stop
2. Need recurrence relation - for processing

Problems : 
1. if base condition is not metioned - segmentation fault - all memeory used.

Types : 
Head recursion : 
 - base condtion - recusion relation - processing

Tail recursion :
 - base condtion - processing - recusion relation
